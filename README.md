Android game
# Description
This game was developed by using Android Studio. You can run it on your Android device or on your PC (of course, if you have installed Android Studio).
At the moment of release game has only English language and one picture-pack avialable. In the future I will add more picture-packs and languages. Also I need to mention
that now you can play only in solo gamemode. There will be an option to play 1v1 in the future. The rules are the same as the rules of Match Match (Pairs).
There are developed two databases to keep your best results. The first one counts time you have spent to find all pairs and the second one counts amount of taps on the screen before you will
find all pairs.
